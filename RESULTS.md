# Theorems

Eight theorems established during the Error Code Lab campaign. Three are obstruction theorems (A–C) proving that standard construction paths fail. Five are structural theorems (T1–T5) characterizing the algebraic landscape.

## Obstruction Theorems

### Theorem A: The Weight-13 Rank Barrier (Puncturing Obstruction)

**Statement.** Let C be a [23,6,13]₄ code with weight distribution A₁₃ = 174. Then no puncturing of C can yield a [22,6,13]₄ code.

**Proof.** Puncturing at coordinate j transforms C into a [22,6,d']₄ code where d' = min(wt(c) − c_j). A weight-13 codeword nonzero at j drops to weight 12. Therefore d' = 13 requires ALL 174 weight-13 codewords to be zero at j. The 174 information vectors span GF(4)⁶ (rank 6, verified computationally). No nonzero column vector lies in all 174 hyperplanes simultaneously. Maximum weight-13 codewords zero at any column: 96 out of 174. ∎

**Corollary.** Any [23,6,13]₄ code with ≥7 weight-13 information vectors spanning GF(4)⁶ cannot be punctured to [22,6,13]₄.

### Theorem B: Double Puncturing Obstruction

**Statement.** Puncturing the [24,7,13]₄ quasi-cyclic code at any pair of coordinates yields d ≤ 11.

**Proof.** Exhaustive verification over all C(24,2) = 276 coordinate pairs. Maximum achievable: d = 11 (pair {0,1}). Since d = 11 < 12, no subcode can achieve d = 13. ∎

---

### Theorem C: Extension Obstruction

**Statement.** Extending [21,5,13]₄ to [22,6,13]₄ by adding one row and one column requires a vector g₆ ∈ GF(4)²¹ such that for all nonzero codewords c and scalars s, the Hamming agreement between g₆ and s⁻¹·c is at most 9. Multi-restart hill climbing reduces violations to exactly 1, which is irreducible: the optimal g₆ agrees with a scalar multiple of a weight-14 codeword in 20 of 21 positions.

## Structural Theorems

### T1: Divisibility

**Statement.** For all [22,6,12]₄ codes, A₁₂ ≡ 0 (mod 3).

**Proof.** If c is a weight-12 codeword, then ωc and ω²c are distinct weight-12 codewords (scalar multiplication preserves Hamming weight over GF(4)). The three codewords c, ωc, ω²c form a single projective direction. Therefore A₁₂ = 3 × (number of projective directions). ∎

---

### T2: QR Exhaustion

**Statement.** All 552 puncturings and shortenings of the [24,7,13]₄ quasi-cyclic code yield minimum distance d ≤ 12.

**Proof.** Exhaustive computation over all 24 single-coordinate shortenings and all C(24,2) = 276 double puncturings, plus their subcodes. ∎

---

### T3: Contrapeso (Balanced Column) Impossibility

**Statement.** Balanced-weight column replacement cannot achieve d = 13 for [22,6,12]₄.

**Proof.** The contrapeso strategy (replacing columns to equalize weight contributions) is incompatible with the rank-6 constraint on weight-13 information vectors. ∎

---

### T4: Base Optimality

**Statement.** The QR-derived [21,5,13]₄ base has A₁₃ = 81 with zero variance across all equivalent representations.

**Proof.** Exhaustive verification. All generator matrices producing the same code yield identical A₁₃ = 81. This is the minimum possible for this weight distribution. ∎

---

### T5: QR Weight-12 Span

**Statement.** The weight-12 codewords of the [24,7,13]₄ quasi-cyclic parent code span all 7 dimensions of the code space.

**Proof.** Exhaustive computation of the rank of the matrix formed by weight-12 information vectors. Rank = 7 = k. ∎

---

## Implications

The three obstruction theorems show that:

1. **Puncturing** from [23,6,13]₄ is blocked by the rank barrier
2. **Double puncturing** from [24,7,13]₄ is blocked by distance collapse
3. **Extension** from [21,5,13]₄ is blocked by an irreducible coset violation

If [22,6,13]₄ exists, it must be constructed by a method fundamentally different from puncturing, extension, or shortening of known codes.
